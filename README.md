## 🧠 About Me

Hi, I'm Rachael (she/her) — a data engineer-in-training with a researcher's mind, a creative heart, and a backend brain.  
I'm currently specialising in data modelling, SQL performance, Python, and scalable data systems.

Originally from a Politics & Behavioural Science background, I bring systems thinking and curiosity to everything I build. Whether I’m designing an ETL pipeline or reverse-engineering a vocal run (yes, I’m that person), I care about structure, flow, and human insight.

I’m currently focused on:

- Building out clean, scalable ETL pipelines  
- Learning database internals and indexing strategies  
- Improving data model design and cloud-native orchestration  
- Creating intuitive, well-structured project documentation  
- Embracing mistakes, learning fast, and becoming more technically fearless

More projects coming soon around:
- Healthcare staffing data  
- ADHD spending pattern modeling  
- Experimental schema design + analytics prototyping
