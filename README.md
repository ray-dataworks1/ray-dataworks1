## 🧠 About Me
Hi, I’m **Rachael (she/her)** — an **Analytics Engineering specialist-in-training** with a researcher's mind, a creative heart, and a backend brain.

I bring **systems thinking** and **curiosity** to every build, whether I’m designing an ETL pipeline or reverse-engineering a vocal run (yes, I’m that person). My goal is to create **data systems that are clean, scalable, and human-friendly**.

**Current focus areas:**
- Building clean, scalable **ETL/ELT pipelines**
- **Database internals** & indexing strategies
- **Semantic data model design** & cloud-native orchestration
- Writing clear, intuitive **project documentation**
- Becoming **technically fearless** through rapid iteration & learning
