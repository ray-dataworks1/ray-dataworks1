## 🧠 About Me

Hi, I'm Rachael (she/her) — a data engineer-in-training with a researcher's mind, a creative heart, and a backend brain.  
I'm currently specialising in data modelling, SQL performance, dbt, Python, and scalable data systems.

Originally from a Politics & Behavioural Science background, I bring systems thinking and curiosity to everything I build. Whether I’m designing an ETL pipeline or reverse-engineering a vocal run (yes, I’m that person), I care about structure, flow, and human insight.

I’m currently focused on:

- Building out clean, scalable ETL pipelines  
- Learning database internals and indexing strategies  
- Improving semantic data model design and cloud-native orchestration  
- Creating intuitive, well-structured project documentation  
- Embracing mistakes, learning fast, and becoming more technically fearless

## 🛠️ Projects

## `data-dungeon-warehouse`
A mini data warehouse project that models commerce data from raw, dirty, synthetically generated CSV files to reflect real-world constraints.  
Tech stack includes: PostgreSQL, PlantUML, and dbt-style modelling (staging, intermediate, and mart layers).

### `apprentice-success-tracker` 
A simulated EdTech analytics project that models apprentice data, using statistical real world bias, for factors affecting success of training, neurodivergent, ethnicity and gender differences in placement rates, perceived readiness and average project scores across three curriculum versions for longitudinal analysis.

### `nhs-waitlist-pipeline (in-progress)`
 A modular analytics engineering pipeline to model elective surgery waitlists across NHS Trusts—surfacing overdue cases, risk-stratified backlogs, and capacity mismatches.
